            <h2>Effectiveness of Adaptation Strategies</h2>
            <p>With evolving technologies, we were curious to analyze the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies against climate change.
                The box plots below show the distribution of crop yield based on the adaptation strategy, however, there does not appear
                to be any significant differences.

            <h2>Adaptation Strategies on Soil Health</h2>
            <p>Even though all the adaptation strategies seemed to influence crop yield pretty similarly on average, we were also concerned with
                the health of the earth beyond what we can sow from the land. The data also gave us data on that country's <a href="https://www.css.cornell.edu/extension/soil-health/2assessment.pdfsoil"target="_blank">soil health</a> 
                as of that year.
