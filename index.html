            <h2>Climate Change and Agriculture</h2>
            <p>
                This website presents an analysis of the impact of climate change on agriculture across different regions and countries 
                from 1990 to 2024. As global concerns over food insecurity, climate change, and ecosystem challenges continue to grow, agriculture 
                stands at the intersection of these critical issues. The sector is inherently dependent on natural resources, such as land and water, that are 
                highly sensitive to shifts in weather patterns and climate conditions. The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationships between 
                environmental factors, such as temperature fluctuations, precipitation levels, and CO2 emissions, and agricultural outcomes, including crop yields. 
                To support this, we are using a comprehensive dataset that spans more than three decades and incorporates data from various countries and a diverse 
                range of crop types, such as barley, rice, corn, and fruits. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends and patterns that illustrate how 
                climate change has influenced agricultural practices and outcomes over time. Ultimately, this work contributes to the ongoing conversation on 
                sustainable agriculture and food security in an increasingly unpredictable climate.

            <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
            <p>The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, 
                and it includes data from 1990 to 2024, covering various regions and crops across the world. It contains 10,000 observations on climate and agricultural trends, including 
                factors like temperature, precipitation, crop yield, CO2 emissions, and extreme weather events. Below is a summary of the key attributes in the dataset:</p>

            <h2>Our Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Through the analysis of this dataset, we have explored how climate change has affected agriculture across different countries and regions. 
                The analysis identifies key trends in temperature increase, precipitation changes, and the frequency of extreme weather events, all of which 
                directly impact crop yields and farming practices. Additionally, the data provides insights into the adoption of adaptation strategies and 
                their role in mitigating these effects. The following sections of the website delve into specific trends, regional variations, and potential strategies for adaptation.
                Despite the breadth of this dataset, we were unable to identify strong correlations between some factors and changes in crop yields. 
                This may be due to the absence of several external and systemic considerations that influence agricultural outcomes. For instance, technological advancements 
                like greenhouses and precision agriculture play a significant role in buffering the effects of climate variability but are not captured in the data. 
                Similarly, improvements in infrastructure, such as storage facilities and supply chains, and innovations in crop genetics and soil microbiome management 
                can sustain yields despite environmental stressors. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors such as government subsidies, trade policies, and localized 
                farming practices contribute to the resilience of agricultural systems. Environmental factors like water quality, pollinator populations, and microclimatic 
                variations also interact with broader trends in ways not fully reflected here. The complex interplay of these factors highlights the importance of a multifaceted 
                approach to understanding and addressing the impacts of climate change on agriculture.
