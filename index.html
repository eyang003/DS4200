            <h2>Climate Change and Agriculture</h2>
            <p>
                This website presents an analysis of the impact of climate change on agriculture across different regions and countries 
                from 1990 to 2024. As global concerns over food insecurity, climate change, and ecosystem challenges continue to grow, agriculture 
                stands at the intersection of these critical issues. The sector is inherently dependent on natural resources, such as land and water, that are 
                highly sensitive to shifts in weather patterns and climate conditions. The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationships between 
                environmental factors, such as temperature fluctuations, precipitation levels, and CO2 emissions, and agricultural outcomes, including crop yields. 
                To support this, we are using a comprehensive dataset that spans more than three decades and incorporates data from various countries and a diverse 
                range of crop types, such as barley, rice, corn, and fruits. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends and patterns that illustrate how 
                climate change has influenced agricultural practices and outcomes over time. Ultimately, this work contributes to the ongoing conversation on 
                sustainable agriculture and food security in an increasingly unpredictable climate.

            <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
            <p>The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, 
                and it includes data from 1990 to 2024, covering various regions and crops across the world. It contains 10,000 observations on climate and agricultural trends, including 
                factors like temperature, precipitation, crop yield, CO2 emissions, and extreme weather events. Below is a summary of the key attributes in the dataset:</p>

            <h2>Summary of Analysis</h2>
            <p>Through the analysis of this dataset, we have explored how climate change has affected agriculture across different countries and regions. 
                The analysis identifies key trends in temperature increase, precipitation changes, and the frequency of extreme weather events, all of which have 
                a direct impact on crop yields and farming practices. In addition, the data reveals insights into the adoption of adaptation strategies and their role 
                in mitigating these effects. The following sections of the website provide deeper insights into specific trends, regions, and potential strategies for adaptation.</p>
