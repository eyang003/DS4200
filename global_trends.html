        <h1>Global Climate Change</h1>
        <p>An overview of how climate change is reshaping agriculture worldwide. Because we had 10k observations,
            we wanted to identify where to start first by identifying any correlations through generating a heatmap 
            correlation matrix to help us identify where to start.

            <h2>Global Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Based on the matrix above, we identified that the average temperature and crop yield had a slightly larger
                correlation than other attributes so we started by analyzing global changes in temperature.
                The map below shows the change in temperatures summed over the years of 1990 - 2024. To do this, we calculated the average
                temperature for each country from 1990 - 1991 and subtracted it from the average of 2023 - 2024. We chose to use 2 year spans to
                smooth out any anomolies in the data for a more accurate view, however, one limitation to this data is that the month the data is 
                recorded is not available, so it is not exactly 'apples to apples'. Even so, just over 3 decades, and the temperature
                differences are apparent, which led us to want to explore how this might affect crop yields.

            <h2>Temperature and Crop Yields</h2>
            <p>Since 1990, global crop yields have faced fluctuations due to rising temperatures, changes in precipitation, and increased CO2 emissions.</p>

            <h2>Climate and CO2 Emissions</h2>
            <p>Global average temperatures have risen in tandem with CO2 emissions, affecting crop productivity and posing a major challenge to food security.</p>

            <h2>Extreme Weather Events</h2>
            <p>The frequency of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, has increased significantly, impacting agricultural stability worldwide.</p>
